/// \brief The iRobot Roomba autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner
/// \details Roomba was introduced in 2002. As of Feb 2014, over
/// 10 million units have been sold worldwide. Roomba features a
/// set of basic sensors that help it perform tasks. For instance,
/// the Roomba is able to change direction on encountering obstacles,
/// detect dirty spots on the floor, and detect steep drops to keep
/// it from falling down stairs. It uses two independently operating
/// wheels that allow 360 degree turns. Additionally, it can adapt
/// to perform other more "creative" tasks using an embedded computer
/// in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.
