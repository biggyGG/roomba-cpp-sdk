This is a C++ wrapper for the iRobot Roomba 500 Series SDK.

*NOTES
- OICommand class is working - you can send commands to the Roomba
- OISensors class is under construction
- No pull requests will be accepted until the deathstar is fully operational...

- To use as is, add "-DDISABLE_SENSORS" to your compile command line
-- Defining DISABLE_SENSORS is not necessary, but it will remove the unusable code from your project.
