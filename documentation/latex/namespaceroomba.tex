\subsection{Detailed Description}
The i\+Robot Roomba autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. 

Roomba was introduced in 2002. As of Feb 2014, over 10 million units have been sold worldwide. Roomba features a set of basic sensors that help it perform tasks. For instance, the Roomba is able to change direction on encountering obstacles, detect dirty spots on the floor, and detect steep drops to keep it from falling down stairs. It uses two independently operating wheels that allow 360 degree turns. Additionally, it can adapt to perform other more \char`\"{}creative\char`\"{} tasks using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.
