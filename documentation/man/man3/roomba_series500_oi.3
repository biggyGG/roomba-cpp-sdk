The Roomba Open Interface (OI) 

The Roomba Open Interface (OI) is a software interface for controlling and manipulating Roomba’s behavior\&. The software interface lets you manipulate Roomba’s behavior and read its sensors through a series of commands, including mode commands, actuator commands, song commands, and sensor commands that you send to the Roomba’s serial port by way of a PC or microcontroller that is connected to the Mini-DIN connector\&.
